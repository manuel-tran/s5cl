# S5CL: Unifying Fully-Supervised, Self-Supervised, and Semi-Supervised Learning Through Hierarchical Contrastive Learning

## Overview
S5CL combines fully-supervised, self-supervised, and semi-supervised learning into one single framework. The approch combines three contrastive losses on labeled, unlabeled and augmented images to learn a hierarchy of feature representations. In particular, given an input, similar images and augmented views are embedded the closest, followed by different looking images, while images from different classes have the greatest distance.
